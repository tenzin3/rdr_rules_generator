<h3 align="center">word segmentation rules generator</h3>

There are some words now which are not segmented properly after the max match which is currently implemented in botok. So training RDR model on that maxmatch output will give us additional rules (.RDR) which could be convert to CQL and be added to botok.

The RDR mode code source is used from https://github.com/datquocnguyen/RDRPOSTagger with some modifications.
